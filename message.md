Hi Angie,

This is Maxim, you forked my resume. I'm just writing to let you know that somebody contacted me looking for you, because
on your website http://angeladang.com/ you have your name on top of my resume. They thought you were a Printio founder
and wanted to ask if you were looking for work. Please update the resume to remove my info from it.

Thanks,
Max
